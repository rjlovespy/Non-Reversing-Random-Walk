1. A Python-3 program is written to animate the Non-reversing Random Walk(NRRW) of a drunkard taking n steps on a plane. 
2. A 2-dimensional NRRW is a walk on a plane such that the drunkard can take a stride for the first step in any of the four directions namely east, west, north, and south but after that, if the (n)th step is along east, west, north, and south then (n+1)th step cannot be along the west, east, south, and north respectively.
